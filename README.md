## About the project 

**Challenge: Beyond the Sunlight: An Aquatic Chemosynthetic World**

Earth's ecosystems heavily rely on sunlight, but imagine an ocean world where chemosynthesis, not photosynthesis, sustains life. Your challenge is to design such a world and its diverse ecosystem, pushing the boundaries of astrobiology beyond traditional Earth-like conditions.

### Aqua-Abyss: Beyond the Sunlight

‚ÄúAqua-Abbys: Beyond the Sunlight‚Äù is the prototype of an interactive game developed as part of the NASA Space Apps Challenge. The principal objective of the project is to create an educational experience for children and young people aged over 10 years old. This game explores the possibility of life in exoplanets due to the chemosynthesis, fostering interest in astrobiology and space science.
The players will assume the role of an astronaut that explores exoplanets in search of life based on chemosynthesis in the face of imminent extinction of life on the Earth due to the sun cooling down in the upcoming 30 years. Through the exploration of a similar environment as Europe, Jupiter‚Äôs Moon, the players will encounter various forms of life that survive in extreme conditions, and they will be able to interact with them to learn about their biology and adaptation. 
This project contributes to encouraging scientific curiosity and the imagination, offering missions that integrate the learning of life in space with gameplay. ‚ÄúAqua-Abyss: Beyond the Sunlight‚Äù is proposed as an educational tool that combines entertainment with learning, promoting scientific exploration between children and youth.
