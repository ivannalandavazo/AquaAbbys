## About the project 

**Challenge: Beyond the Sunlight: An Aquatic Chemosynthetic World**

Earth's ecosystems heavily rely on sunlight, but imagine an **ocean world** where **chemosynthesis**, not photosynthesis, sustains life. Your challenge is to design such a world and its diverse ecosystem, pushing the boundaries of astrobiology beyond traditional Earth-like conditions.

### Aqua-Abyss: Beyond the Sunlight

**‚ÄúAqua-Abbys: Beyond the Sunlight‚Äù** is the prototype of an **interactive game** developed as part of the NASA Space Apps Challenge. The principal objective of the project is to **create an educational experience** for children and young people aged over 10 years old. This game explores the possibility of life in exoplanets due to the chemosynthesis, fostering interest in astrobiology and space science.

The players will assume the role of an astronaut that explores **exoplanets** in search of life based on chemosynthesis in the face of imminent extinction of life on the Earth due to the sun cooling down in the upcoming 30 years. Through the exploration of a similar environment as Europe, Jupiter‚Äôs Moon, the players will encounter various forms of life that survive in **extreme conditions**, and they will be able to interact with them to learn about their biology and adaptation. 
This project contributes to **encouraging scientific curiosity and the imagination**, offering missions that integrate the learning of life in space with gameplay. ‚ÄúAqua-Abyss: Beyond the Sunlight‚Äù is proposed as an educational tool that combines entertainment with learning, promoting scientific exploration between children and youth.

## Research

### 

In the search for life beyond the Solar System, specifically on **aquatic exoplanets**, the hypothesis of the existence of unknown ecosystems has developed, which may present extreme conditions, such as high pressure, extreme temperatures, and the absence of sunlight, among others. Nevertheless, these conditions do not prevent the development of life in such environments. A significant example of this is the existence of life in the depths of Earth's oceans, where **chemosynthesis** allows organisms to survive in these inhospitable conditions. 

Considering the possibility of life on aquatic exoplanets through chemosynthesis, it is essential to explore the **adaptability** of organisms in extreme conditions. Focusing on such imaginative situations will expand our knowledge about the universe itself. This could change the perception of what we consider a habitable world. By understanding how **chemosynthetic organisms** function and evolve, we would gain valuable information about the evolution and origin of life.
