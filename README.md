## Research


### Introduction

In the search for life beyond the Solar System, specifically on **aquatic exoplanets**, the hypothesis of the existence of unknown ecosystems has developed, which may present extreme conditions, such as high pressure, extreme temperatures, and the absence of sunlight, among others. Nevertheless, these conditions do not prevent the development of life in such environments. A significant example of this is the existence of life in the depths of Earth's oceans, where **chemosynthesis** allows organisms to survive in these inhospitable conditions. 

Considering the possibility of life on aquatic exoplanets through chemosynthesis, it is essential to explore the **adaptability** of organisms in extreme conditions. Focusing on such imaginative situations will expand our knowledge about the universe itself. This could change the perception of what we consider a habitable world. By understanding how **chemosynthetic organisms** function and evolve, we would gain valuable information about the evolution and origin of life.

Exploring the **possibility of life on aquatic exoplanets through chemosynthesis** is vital to understand the adaptability of organisms in extreme conditions. Focusing on such imaginative situations will broaden our understanding of the universe. This could alter our perception of what constitutes a habitable world. By comprehending the functioning and evolution of chemosynthetic organisms, we would acquire valuable insights into the evolution and origin of life.

This knowledge may **inspire** technological innovations to tackle contemporary challenges on Earth. Thus, fields such as biotechnology, ecology, and space exploration would be advanced, enabling solutions to current issues, such as food production deficiencies, lack of clean energy, and the production of relevant chemical compounds in medicine and engineering. 





### Background

#### Earth-like Planets
Scientist Lynnae Quick from **NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center** in Greenbelt, Maryland, discovered that more than a quarter of a dozen exoplanets she was studying, including those in the nearby **TRAPPIST-1** system, show a high likelihood of being oceanic beneath various layers of surface ice, similar to the cases of Europa and Enceladus. 

To determine this, one would need to measure the heat emitted by an exoplanet or detect volcanic eruptions within it, which would be caused by liquid or vaporized molten rock. Thus, life could exist, as the heat from hydrothermal vents might be found on the ocean floor. Moreover, sharing similarities with Earth, such as size, could indicate that the planet is more solid than gaseous, making it more likely to have water on its surface (Kazmierczak, 2020).



![trappist](https://github.com/ivannalandavazo/AquaAbbys/blob/main/Images/trappist.jpg)














#### Enceladus and Europa
Jupiter is one of the planets in our solar system, with over 90 moons orbiting around it. Among these, Europa stands out as one of the main candidates for hosting life. Europa is located more than five times the distance from the Sun as Earth, placing it very far from our star.

Despite its remoteness, it is known that this satellite has a core composed of iron and nickel, surrounded by silicate rocks, and an ice crust. Below this crust, it is believed that there is an ocean of liquid water that does not freeze completely due to tidal activity. These tides are caused by intense gravitational interaction with Jupiter, which also keeps Europa in its orbit around the gas giant.

Another natural satellite with similar characteristics is Enceladus, one of over 140 natural satellites orbiting Saturn. Enceladus is made up of a large amount of ice, subsurface oceans, and large fissures 2 kilometers wide and 500 meters deep. These four fissures are known as "Tiger Stripes," as they emit liquid water and large ice crystals, some of which contribute to Saturn's "E-ring."

#### Aquatic Exoplanets: Kepler System
A team of researchers from the University of Montreal found evidence that the planets in the Kepler-138 system could be aquatic planets. 
The Kepler-138 system consists of three confirmed exoplanets, Kepler-138 b, Kepler-138 c, and Kepler-138 d, each with its own characteristics, with Kepler-138 b being the closest to the star, while Kepler-138 c and Kepler-138 d are basically ‚Äútwin‚Äù planets, meaning they are nearly the same size and mass. In the initial investigation, the water surface of these two planets was not directly detected, but it was concluded that a large fraction of their volume was made up of lighter materials than rock and heavier than hydrogen or helium, leading astronomers to conclude that they are composed of water. This theory was later confirmed by another study conducted using NASA's Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes, comparing these planets to the icy moons of our solar system, Europa and Enceladus, which are also largely composed of water surrounding a rocky core. Caroline Paulet, who leads the research at the University of Montreal, stated, ‚ÄúImagine larger versions of Europa or Enceladus, the water-rich moons orbiting Jupiter and Saturn, but much closer to their star.‚Äù Instead of having an icy surface like the moons of our solar system, researchers warn that the planets would not have oceans or a layer of ice directly, but due to the high temperatures found on Kepler-138 d and Kepler-138 c, which exceed the boiling point of water, the planets are expected to have a dense vapor atmosphere, and beneath this atmosphere, there could be liquid water at high pressure, making these worlds potentially habitable.

In the same research with the Hubble and Spitzer telescopes, researchers also found evidence of a fourth planet in the system, named Kepler-138 e. This newly discovered planet is small and orbits farther from its star than the other three planets, taking only 38 days to complete an orbit. Unlike its neighboring planets, the nature of this new planet remains unknown, but it lies within the habitable zone of its star.

#### Interstellar Planets and Their Characteristics
Interstellar planets, also known as rogue or solitary planets, are characterized by not experiencing sunrises and sunsets, as they do not belong to any solar system nor orbit close to a star. Without sunlight, they remain in perpetual darkness. This phenomenon occurs when, in the early stages of solar system formation, gravitational forces can expel one or more planets, moving them away from their stars.

A lesser-known characteristic of many interstellar planets is that they may have a molten core while their surface remains completely frozen. Due to these conditions, it is possible that some of them contain oceans of liquid water beneath their icy crust. ‚ÄúRogue planets have molten cores, even though the surface is completely frozen. Between these extremes, there may exist oceans of liquid water,‚Äù states Neil DeGrasse.

#### TESS and JWST: Searching for Potentially Habitable Exoplanets
Launched in 2018, TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) has pioneered the identification of transiting exoplanets, using an approach that has allowed it to detect thousands of exoplanet candidates in a relatively short time. To date, TESS has confirmed over 300 exoplanets, and its data have propelled research into their composition and atmosphere. One of TESS's most notable discoveries is the exoplanet TOI 700 d, which lies within the habitable zone of its star. This finding has spurred studies about its potential to harbor life and has opened the door for research into other similar exoplanets.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), launched in December 2021, represents a significant advancement in space exploration. Its ability to observe in the infrared allows for the study of exoplanet atmospheres with unprecedented resolution. Since its launch, scientists have begun analyzing atmospheric compounds in exoplanets such as WASP-39 b and LHS 475 b, identifying elements like water and carbon dioxide, which are crucial for assessing habitability. JWST observations are essential for understanding potential ecosystems, including those that could be based on chemosynthesis.

#### Relationship Between Chemosynthesis and Organisms 
Many organisms feed on bacteria found on the ocean floor, particularly around hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, as these are locations where chemical compounds and elements, such as hydrogen sulfide, emerge. This hydrogen sulfide is utilized to generate energy through chemosynthesis, leading to a symbiotic relationship between them. The bacteria obtain a habitat within the organism‚Äôs body in exchange for producing food for the host (Douglas Wilkin | Jean Brainard, 2024).


#### Underwater Life Without Sunlight
Some evolutionary origins suggest that most current marine organisms shared common ancestors that lived at the surface. Over time, the oceans expanded, forcing these organisms to adapt to specific conditions in the depths. An example of this adaptation is to darkness; as depth increases, less light penetrates the water, resulting in physical changes in their systems, particularly concerning predation. Furthermore, it has been shown that organisms living in the depths evolved to feed on animal remains that sink to the ocean floor after death, as well as through chemosynthesis.

Several extremophiles living in the deepest parts of the Earth's oceans, including abyssal fish, cephalopods, and echinoderms, share the following similarities:  

- ##### Bioluminescence:
Many animals can produce their own light through chemical reactions in their bodies, which helps them attract prey, communicate, or evade predators.  

- ##### Transparent or Gelatinous Bodies
Organisms have transparent or gelatinous bodies, facilitating camouflage and evasion of predators.  

- ##### Large Eyes:
Abyssal animals often possess large eyes to maximize light capture.  

- ##### Heightened Senses:
They have highly developed senses, such as smell and the ability to detect vibrations, allowing them to find food and navigate their environment. 

- ##### Varied Sizes: 
In the depths, organisms can be both giant and very small.  

- ##### Pale or Dark Coloring:
They typically have coloration ranging from dark gray to black, aiding in concealment in the dark ocean floor.  

- ##### Feeding:
Due to the lack of light, there is no vegetation. They obtain food through direct predation. Another significant food source for these species comes from animals that die in the upper layers of the ocean and sink.

#### Effects of Planetary Conditions on the Human Body 
In an environment with low pressure, various consequences may arise. Some examples include:  

- ##### Constant oxygen loss:
As one descends on this planet, it is understood that with decreasing pressure, oxygen levels will also drop.

- ##### Decompression:
A rapid descent from high altitude can lead to decompression sickness, where gas bubbles form in the body‚Äôs tissues.  

- ##### Gas expansion:
Gasses inside the body, such as in the lungs, expand due to the pressure differences.  

- ##### Changes in blood flow and blood pressure:
This can force the heart to work harder, leading to cardiovascular issues.  

- ##### Low pressure and oxygen shortage:
This may result in cognitive problems, perception issues, and alterations in mental state.  

- ##### Freezing from low temperatures:
This can occur due to the absence of warmth surrounding the body.

- #### Cephalopods:
"Cephalopods are the largest and most intelligent invertebrates. They are a class of marine mollusks characterized by having tentacles on their heads and lacking an external shell" (Fundaci√≥n Aquae, 2022).  





![cepha](https://github.com/ivannalandavazo/AquaAbbys/blob/main/Images/cephalopods.jpg)











- #### **Chemosynthesis**

Chemosynthesis is a common process in deep aquatic environments where sunlight does not reach, driven by the presence of hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. Hydrothermal vents are cracks in the ocean floor that emit hot water rich in minerals. They occur when ocean water seeps into the ground, is heated by magma, and then emerges from these cracks, bringing elements like sulfur, copper, zinc, gold, iron, and helium. The water that exits can reach temperatures over 400¬∞C, but due to the pressure at depth, it does not boil. There are black smokers, which are deposits of iron sulfide, and white smokers, which are deposits of barium, calcium, and silicon.

Cold seeps are similar to hydrothermal vents but differ in that they release gasses or fluids rich in hydrocarbons, such as hydrogen sulfide and methane, at cold temperatures or at the level of seawater. They form when there is a large amount of hydrocarbons stored beneath the seabed. These seeps can be classified according to the types of chemicals they release, leading to classifications like methane seeps, brine seeps, mud volcanoes, and oil seeps (NOAA Ocean Exploration, 2024).

![echino](https://github.com/ivannalandavazo/AquaAbbys/blob/main/Images/echinoderms.jpeg)












- #### Exoplanet: 
An exoplanet, or extrasolar planet, is a celestial body that orbits a star outside our solar system. These planets can vary in size, composition, and environmental conditions and are classified based on various criteria.  

![exo](https://github.com/ivannalandavazo/AquaAbbys/blob/main/Images/exoplanetas2.jpg)






- #### Extremophiles:
Extremophiles are organisms that thrive in extreme environmental conditions that are inhospitable to most forms of life. They are characterized by their ability to tolerate and adapt to conditions considered outside normal ranges of temperature, pH, salinity, pressure, and other environmental factors.  

![extremo](https://github.com/ivannalandavazo/AquaAbbys/blob/main/Images/extremophiles.jpeg)
